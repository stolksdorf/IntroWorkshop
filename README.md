# brainstation

This is an improved teaching app for BrainStation's Intro to HTML and CSS workshop. Check it out [here](http://stolksdorf.github.io/brainstation/)

### Improvements to the app

* No need to log in or create accounts
* No need to create unique project names
* Saving and storage is done completely client-side
* UI is improved and made to look more like BrainStation's homepage
* Progressing steps doesn't inject code wherever your cursor is
* It saves whenever you preview/launch, so no need worrying about that
* The code for steps is cleanly stored in the steps folder, easy to update and review
* Removed the complex image uploader. It's too much for an intro workshop and not even applicable in the real world. Much better for participants to just reference images absolutely.
* Clicking back in steps doesn't inject random bits of code 
* It uses just about as much css and html as the example resume site it's teaching does ;)

### Improvements to the lesson

* Greatly simplified the html and css
* Reduced nearly all superflous and confusing css
* Consistent with naming of classes and got rid of ids
* The avatar doesn't use any position tricks, simple ngative margins
* The steps have been arrranged to have more logical content and better flow
* Added the footer in to edit, was confusing to a lot of people why it was showing up before
* Moved the social icons inot an upper right container, showcasing a better use case for position absolute
* Simplified the markup for the social icons
* Uses semantic markup as much as possible
* Added a skills section to show off lists
